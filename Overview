# This webpage is designed to look like Amazon.com using Datatables API:  https://datatables-ecom.000webhostapp.com/
# The site is able to add new items to cart, delete items, or make changes.
# The site can also add new items to sell.
# All code is safe from SQLI injections. 
# All HTML and CSS is compliant with HTML5 validator.

# Room for improvements:
# I never made a complex login system due to the fact that most of that is already encripted anyway.
# Clearly, I never added a payment system as that would be unethical. My site already accidentaly got taken down by Google because they 
# thought it was a "scam" site. 

# If you have any suggestions or questions, email me at scott.schmidt1989@yahoo.com
